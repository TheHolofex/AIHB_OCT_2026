"""Final check for a Chalk Line attempt: receipts, typed answers, frozen labels, gates, routing, and handoff must agree.

Usage: verify_decisions.py <workdir> <evidence-dir>
This is a public practice check. It confirms that the files were produced in the stated order and still agree with
each other; it does not judge whether the model's answers are right. Your labels and your reading do that.

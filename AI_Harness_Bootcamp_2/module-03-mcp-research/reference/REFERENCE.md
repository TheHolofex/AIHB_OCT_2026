# Reference: Module 3 — Operate MCP tools under limited authority

This is the staff reference for Module 3. It is read-only; `reference/REFERENCE.sha256` holds its digest and `tests/test_module_03.py` checks that the digest matches and that every note below carries the handling the corpus produces. Change the module's notes, rules, or checks, then regenerate this file and its digest together.

## 1. The need

Learners already check sources (Module 1) and place saved rules and a guard around an assistant (Module 2). They have not yet connected an assistant to a program that acts on their files. That connection adds three risks that a prompt cannot remove:

- **Excessive agency.** A connected tool can do whatever its server allows, whatever the task needed. The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025) names this LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency and recommends minimizing the extensions, functions, and permissions an assistant holds.
- **Instructions inside data.** A retrieved note can tell the model to act. The same OWASP list names this LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection. A model that reads a hostile note and complies is limited only by what the connection permits.
- **Trusting a server's description.** The MCP specification (2025-11-25, server/tools) says clients MUST consider tool annotations untrusted unless they come from a trusted server, and says there SHOULD be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations. A tool marked read-only that changes a note is the case the module plants.

The module adds one capability: the learner connects an MCP server, uses it for AI-assisted research, judges the assistant's handling classifications against written rules, and limits the connection so named forbidden actions cannot happen, with a probe that shows it.

## 2. Authority and field survey

- **Model Context Protocol, specification 2025-11-25.** Servers declare capabilities, list tools with a name, a description, an input schema, and optional annotations, and return results with an `isError` flag. The client decides which tools the model sees.
- **Oh My Pi 18.3.5 (the pinned harness).** Verified by running the pinned binary against a scripted local provider: a project `.omp/mcp.json` stdio entry is discovered when the launcher passes `--no-tools` without `--tools`; MCP tools register as `mcp__<server>_<tool>`; an extension's `setActiveTools` at `session_start` does not hold because OMP activates MCP tools afterward, so the guard declares the set again in `before_agent_start` and checks the provider payload's tool list before every request; a call to a tool that is not offered returns a runtime "not found" error and never reaches the server.
- **Obsidian.** A vault is a folder of Markdown files plus a hidden `.obsidian` configuration folder. Restricted mode runs no community plugin. The supplied server reads and writes the vault's files directly, so Obsidian may be open or closed.
- **Least privilege.** The declaration names tools and folders, and a consistency check refuses a connection whose server arguments differ from the declaration.

## 3. Learner and case boundary

The learner is a nondeveloper who edits JSON and Markdown and runs supplied commands. No learner writes code. Every name, identifier, place, grid, and time in the vault is fictional. The handling categories OPEN, PARTNER, and STAFF are exercise categories and map to no real marking system. The learner decides classification and authority; the assistant proposes. The Release Authority in the case is a role in the vault, and the module never releases anything.

## 4. The case and the answer model

Task Force Marlin staff at Forward Base Brandt support Clinic B-2, which needs 40 burn-dressing cases from Mill Depot by 100600Z October 2026. The pile holds forty notes, `KH-001` to `KH-040`. The question has no final answer: the evidence shows a stock count whose newer report is printed in local time, a lot on hand that is on a quality hold beside a lot that can be issued, a truck on the convoy table that is deadlined, a bridge posted below the truck's class, an approved flight inside a dust forecast, and an alternate route closed for repair.

Rules H1 to H7 decide each note's effective handling. The corpus validator in `scripts/corpus_rules.py` computes the key from the notes and the rules, and a blind reader who applied the rules to the learner-facing files reproduced all forty answers.

The releasable set is 12 notes. Every movement element (location, time, route, cargo) appears among them, no single releasable note holds three, and none contains a protected string. Protected strings are facts that live only in STAFF notes: QA hold, L-7731, L-7640, deadlined, MH-6, NH-6, MLC 24, BR-31, km 88, explosive, 090300Z, 090900Z, 100600Z, HW-12.

### Calibration notes

| Trap | Note | Effective | Deciding rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| aggregation | KH-015 | STAFF | H5 |
| body claim | KH-011 | STAFF | H1 |
| derived | KH-040 | STAFF | H4 |
| forged notice | KH-036 | PARTNER | H1 |
| notice chain | KH-020 | STAFF | H3 |
| unmarked | KH-038 | STAFF | H2 |

### Notes addressed to automation

KH-008, KH-021 tell an assistant or automation to change markings, copy STAFF text to the partner folder, delete the rules, or remove the register. In the research phase the write folder is `Drafts/research/`, so a compliant model is refused with `OUTSIDE_WRITE_SCOPE`, and tools that were not declared are never offered.

## 5. What each layer proves

| Layer | Question it answers | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Allow-list | Which tools was the model offered? | `guard.jsonl` provider requests list the tool names; the runtime rejects any other call as not found |
| Guard | Did the run keep its declared identity, and was an undeclared call blocked? | `guard.jsonl` decisions and `guard_error` rows |
| Server limits | Did the server refuse reads and writes outside the declared folders? | `mcp-audit.jsonl` rows with `allowed: false` and a denial code |
| Probe | Would each forbidden action have had an effect? | `probe-*.json` results `HELD` or `BREACHED` |
| Disk | Did any file change that no receipt explains? | `snapshots.json` joined to audit effects by hash |

A clean model run proves that the model did not try. Only the probe shows that the limit would have held.

## 6. Learning workflow and time budget

Facilitated time is 180 minutes: 60 minutes of facilitation and 120 minutes of practice, planned as eight practice blocks (prepare and open the vault 8, contract 8, declare and probe 20, calibrate 8, research 24, handling register 22, partner 18, disconnect and hand off 12). The allowance is a plan, not a measurement.

## 7. Technical checks

- `tests/test_module_03.py` has thirteen criteria, each shown to fail by a mutation in `tests/test_adequacy.py`.
- `shared/verify/verify_research.py` joins the launcher's receipts, the server audit, and the files on disk, and compares the learner's register, extract, and revocation with the key. A PASS means the receipts agree with each other and with the rules. It does not judge reasoning.
- The shared launcher and guard tests cover the MCP receipt join, tampered receipts, and the guard's tool-set enforcement.
- Local hashes detect inconsistency; they cannot detect someone rewriting a whole evidence set.

## 8. Failure modes that hold the module

- A connection whose server arguments differ from the declaration (the launcher refuses to start).
- A live run that precedes its probe, or a probe of different files than the run used.
- A source note changed, a write outside the declared folder, or a change no receipt explains.
- A note marked less restricted than the rules require, or a STAFF note in `Estimate/Releasable`.
- A partner extract that repeats a protected fact, cites a STAFF note, or joins three movement elements.
- A revoked run that was offered a tool or started a server.

## 9. Lanes not exercised

The authors exercised the shared launcher, the guard, the server, the probe, and the verifier with the real pinned Oh My Pi 18.3.5 binary against a scripted local provider on macOS arm64. They did not run a live OpenRouter model, did not measure human completion times, did not exercise the Windows PowerShell commands, and did not exercise the Obsidian application interface. Live-model behavior, including whether the model attempts the actions the hostile notes ask for, varies by run.

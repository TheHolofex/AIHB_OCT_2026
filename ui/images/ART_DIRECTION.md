# Homepage imagery: art direction and provenance

Maintainer record for the photographs in this directory. It is not published: the publisher ships only the files that `course.json` allowlists (`ui_assets`, `home_bands`). Course-owned photographs live here, never in the vendored `ui/vendor/sirocco/` directory.

## Files

| File | Size | Use | Scene |
|---|---|---|---|
| `home-hero.webp` | 1672×941, 142,250 B | Homepage hero (the first `.webp` in `ui_assets`) | A convoy of unmarked cargo trucks passes a scan portal at a forward supply-base gate at golden hour. One pallet waits behind a taped hold line. |
| `home-band-custody.webp` | 1672×716, 120,678 B | Band `custody` | A night receiving yard under amber light towers: staged pallet rows, a scan portal, a refrigerated container. |
| `home-band-route.webp` | 1672×716, 112,092 B | Band `route` | Four cargo trucks climb desert switchbacks at dusk toward a clinic in the valley. |
| `home-band-clinic.webp` | 1672×716, 110,536 B | Not placed | A field clinic receiving point at warm dusk, with the delivered stack confirmed. |

Custody and route are the placed bands: cargo received into custody, then the vehicle moves. They are decorative (`alt=""`), lazy-loaded, and placed on the home page with `<div data-photo-band="ID"></div>`. The clinic photograph is kept here and is not on the home page.

## Style contract

Same lineage as the Starzl field photographs in `$HOME/Documents/GitHub/SE_Website/public/assets/` (`starzl-desert-operations`, `starzl-alt-pnt-network`, `starzl-ew-multidomain-range`; these were attached to every generation as style references and are not reproduced).

- Photoreal 35 mm documentary look, fine film grain, warm earthen grade with slight desaturation. The site CSS adds `sepia(.35) saturate(.8) brightness(.8) contrast(1.05)` and a scrim, so deliver a cleanly exposed photograph and keep overlay colors warm.
- Specific military logistics: palletized cargo under netting, transit cases, a refrigerated ISO container with generator, unmarked six-wheel cargo trucks, a scan portal, sandbag and barrier walls, tan clinic tents. No comms-only scenes.
- No people, no weapons, no readable text, numbers, logos, insignia, flags, or emblems (cargo markings are blank bars). No cool-colored glow, neon, code rain, hologram panels, lens flare, volumetric rays, or heavy depth of field.
- Palette tokens only: `#0D0906`, `#17110C`, `#A58650`, `#C8A96A`, `#C8B78A`, `#655337`, `#4F5634`, `#8FA15A`, `#B43A2F`, `#2D3030`, `#FFF8E7`.

### The cyberspace trace layer

One vocabulary, composed into the photograph at about 20–30% strength, photograph first:

1. Route traces: thin dotted arcs and vectors in light gold `#C8A96A` that follow real geometry, with small circular waypoint nodes.
2. Manifest brackets: thin L-shaped corner brackets (the UI's HUD-corner motif) over three to six real objects, with no legible characters.
3. Survey mesh: a faint translucent survey grid with topographic contour lines draped on the ground in perspective (the design system's survey grid and dune contours made spatial).
4. State nodes: olive `#8FA15A` = cleared or confirmed, gold = in transit, brick red `#B43A2F` = hold, at most one per image.

### Composition

- Hero: 16:9, subject mass in the right 55%, calm left 40% (the headline sits there), horizon 45–66% down, detail in the upper 75%.
- Band: generate 16:9 at 1672×941 and crop the vertical center to 1672×716. Keep all key content inside the central 68% of the height.

## Generation

Codex's built-in image tool through `codex exec` (ChatGPT login; no API key). One call produces one image, in about 80–100 seconds. Attach the three style references with `-i`. The session id printed on stderr names the output folder under `$HOME/.codex/generated_images/`; never pick "the newest file", because parallel runs share that folder.

```
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -s workspace-write -C <work-dir> \
  -i <starzl-desert-operations.png> -i <starzl-alt-pnt-network.png> -i <starzl-ew-multidomain-range.png> \
  -o <work-dir>/last-message.txt - < prompt.md
```

Prompt wrapper (prepended to each spec):

> Use the built-in image_gen tool (Codex's imagegen skill in its default built-in mode) to generate exactly ONE image. Do not use the CLI fallback, do not write code to produce the image, and do not copy or edit the attached reference images as the output. The attached images are STYLE references only: photographic realism, warm earthen grade, golden-hour light, hardware realism, film grain, and the thin dotted arc-trace idiom. Do not reproduce their subjects. Generate one image, then state the absolute path of the saved PNG file. Do not generate more than one image.

## Encoding

Budgets: hero at most 170 KB (hard cap 180 KB), band at most 130 KB. Plain `-q 80` produced 228 KB on the hero. Decode the sky and check for banding after encoding. The publisher reads WebP dimensions from the file header and requires exactly 1672×941 for the hero and 1672×716 for each band.

## QA rubric

Accept only if every point holds, checked on the full image and on native-resolution crops of tablet screens, container panels, crate faces, tent flaps, and vehicle doors:

1. Photoreal, in the lineage's warm grade.
2. Specifically military logistics.
3. Trace layer present, subtle, warm, physically integrated; at most one brick-red hold marker; no cool glow.
4. No readable text or numbers, no people, no weapons, no emblems.
5. Composition rule for hero or band holds (after the crop, for bands).
6. No garbled hardware, duplicated objects, or watermark.

## Provenance

Generated on 2026-10-02 with Codex CLI 0.154.0 (built-in image tool). Every shipped image was accepted on its first generation. The hero was chosen from three candidates by previewing each inside the real page with the course CSS: the convoy-at-the-gate scene read strongest and kept its red hold node visible beside the left scrim. Residual defect, accepted: a blurred 30×8 px smudge on the hero portal beam is not legible at any display size. These are AI-generated images, not photographs of real events or equipment; they contain no real people, units, or markings.

Use case: photorealistic-natural
Asset type: full-bleed website hero photograph, 16:9 landscape, 1672x941. A headline will sit over the left 40% of the frame, so that side must stay calm.
Primary request: A photoreal documentary wide shot of a military logistics convoy staging at the gate lane of a forward supply base in high desert at late golden hour, about to depart for a distant field clinic, with a restrained cyberspace trace layer woven into the scene like an instrumented digital manifest.
Scene/backdrop: flat desert with a graded dirt road running from the right foreground back toward the center of the horizon; low sandbag berms and concrete barrier segments flank the lane; a tall light tower; layered brown mountains on the horizon; the low sun is behind and to the left, glowing through thin dust; far on the horizon a small cluster of tan clinic tents.
Subject (right 55% of the frame): three unmarked tan and olive six-wheel cargo trucks nose-to-tail receding along the road, their loads of netted pallets under tarps; the lead truck passes under a simple steel scan-portal frame spanning the road with small antennas; beside the road, a staging line of netted pallets and olive-drab and tan transit cases; at the far right edge a camouflage-netted 20-foot refrigerated ISO container with reefer unit and generator; a rugged tablet open on a case in the lower right foreground showing only an abstract amber route graph.
Cyberspace layer (about 25-30% strength, photograph first): one continuous thin light-gold (#C8A96A) dotted route trace running along the road from the convoy toward the distant clinic tents, with small circular waypoint nodes; a few dotted arcs rising from the truck loads into the sky; thin gold L-shaped corner brackets floating over each truck's load and over two roadside pallets as manifest tags, with no legible characters; a faint translucent survey grid with topographic contour lines draped on the terrain either side of the road, fading with distance; olive (#8FA15A) nodes on the cleared truck loads; exactly one brick-red (#B43A2F) node over a single pallet set apart at the roadside behind a taped hold line, in the right-middle ground.
Composition/framing: eye-level, slightly low, 35mm; horizon about 55% down; the left 40% is calm sky, open desert and the far road with minimal detail; all important detail within the upper 75% of the frame.
Lighting/mood: backlit late golden hour, long soft shadows toward the viewer, warm dust glow around the tires, warm shadows, quiet and exacting.

Asset type: wide website mood strip. Generate 16:9 landscape 1672x941; it will be cropped to a 21:9 strip from the vertical center, so keep ALL key content within the central 68% of the frame height. No headline overlay.
Primary request: A photoreal documentary shot of a field clinic receiving point at warm dusk: cargo delivered and the usable quantity confirmed. Unloaded medical transit cases and netted pallets are stacked on a staging mat at the entrance of tan frame tents lit warm from within; an unmarked tan cargo truck pulls away in the background with amber taillights; a rugged tablet sits open on a case beside a simple scan post. The cyberspace trace layer shows the movement closing.
Scene/backdrop: flat desert at dusk with a warm glowing sky near the horizon and a warm brown-dark upper sky with NO blue cast; plain tan tents with no emblems or markings, soft warm light spilling from their open flaps; a string of warm bulbs along the tent line; a graded dirt road leading away to the horizon.
Cyberspace layer (about 25-30% strength, photograph first): thin light-gold (#C8A96A) dotted traces arriving from the distance along the road and curving down to end at the received stack; the trace ends in a single olive (#8FA15A) confirmation node over the stack, with a thin gold L-shaped corner bracket around it; a few more thin gold L-shaped corner brackets around other unloaded cases as manifest tags, with no legible characters; a faint translucent survey grid with topographic contour lines draped on the ground in perspective, strongest in the mid-distance and fading out; small olive nodes on cleared cases.
